# Vending Machine Approval Kata - Reject Penny branch

On this branch there is already some functionality implemented for the [Vending Machine Kata](https://sammancoaching.org/kata_descriptions/vending_machine.html). Your task is to add a couple of features using TDD, each guided by an approval test and a sketch of the planned functionality.

1. Make sure the existing tests pass.
1. Uncomment the test 'rejectPenny' and use the sketch [reject penny](java/Feature_penny_rejected.png) to guide you as you implement the feature.
1. Make a new sketch for the "return coins" feature. 
1. Uncomment the test 'returnCoins' and use it and the sketch to guide you as you implement this feature.
