# Vending Machine Approval Kata - TextTest version

1. The starting position has a test for Accept Coins. The use_case.py file contains one act step - insert a nickel. The test is not complete - the printer should show the state of the VendingMachine before and after the act step. Currently it prints a placeholder. Write the printer code to display the coins the machine and other relevant state.
1. Add additional 'act' and 'print' steps which insert other coin types and check they work correctly.
1. Implement the "return coins" feature. You can either do this for yourself or you can take a shortcut and look at the branch 'return_coins'. Be sure to test the new feature - redesign your printer as needed.
1. Implement the "select product" feature. Again there is a branch "select_product" if you want to take a shortcut. Write a test for this feature too.
1. Continue adding features and tests until you have completed everything in the kata description.
